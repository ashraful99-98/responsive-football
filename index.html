        <h2>Copa America 2021 final: It’s Messi v Neymar, Argentina v Brazil<span>(Highlights)</span></h2>
        <p>It is also another tournament where Argentina – and more notably Messi – are seeking to end a long trophy
            drought.
            They have not won a major title since lifting the Copa America in 1993 and Messi has never won silverware
            with the national side.
            Brazil are narrow favourites and not just because they are at home and have a slightly better record so far
            in the tournament. They also have a reputation for beating Argentina in crunch games.
            The two sides have met four times in finals, three in the Copa America and one in the Confederations Cup –
            in 2005.</p>
